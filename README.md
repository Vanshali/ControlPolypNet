## 1. Introduction

In recent years, generative models have been very popular in medical imaging applications because they generate realistic-looking synthetic images, which is crucial for the medical domain. These generated images often complement the hard-to-obtain annotated authentic medical data because acquiring such data requires expensive manual effort by clinical experts and raises privacy concerns. Moreover, with recent diffusion models, the generated data can be controlled using a conditioning mechanism, simultaneously ensuring diversity within synthetic samples. This control can allow experts to generate data based on different scenarios, which would otherwise be hard to obtain. However, how well these models perform for colonoscopy still needs to be explored. Do they preserve clinically significant information in generated frames? Do they help in downstream tasks such as polyp segmentation? Therefore, in this work, we propose ControlPolypNet, a novel stable diffusion based framework. We control the generation process (polyp size, shape and location) using a novel custom-masked input control, which generates images preserving important endoluminal information. Additionally, our model comprises a detection module, which discards some of the generated images that do not possess lesion characterising features, ensuring clinically relevant data. We further utilize the generated polyp frames to improve performance in the downstream task of polyp segmentation. Using these generated images, we found an average improvement of 6.84% and 1.3% (Jaccard index) on the CVC-ClinicDB and Kvasir-SEG datasets, respectively.
